# Global-Climate-Diagnostics-via-Big-Data-Analytics
Project Overview  
This project harnesses the power of big data analytics to scrutinize historical climate data from a conceptual steel vault located in Tasmania. Designed to mimic a plane's black box, this vault holds crucial climate data intended to guide future civilizations in understanding past human impacts on climate change. Utilizing Apache Spark on Google Cloud Platform, this initiative delves into temperature and CO2 emission data to uncover long-term environmental trends and their implications.  

Features  
Data Exploration: Analyzes comprehensive datasets containing average land temperatures by country from 1750 to 2015, and CO2 emissions per capita from 1960 to 2014.  
Big Data Tools: Employs Apache Spark for data processing and analysis to handle large-scale datasets efficiently, facilitated through Google Cloud Platform.  
Data Integration: Merges temperature and CO2 emissions datasets to explore correlations and develop a deeper understanding of climate change dynamics over time.  
Statistical Analysis: Investigates the relations ip between CO2 emissions and temperature changes, identifying key trends and outliers across various geographical regions.  
Technology Implementation: Details the creation and utilization of a Google Cloud cluster to run Spark jobs, enhancing the capability to process large datasets beyond the limitations of traditional computing resources.  
Environmental Impact Reflection: Encourages personal reflection on individual environmental impacts, promoting awareness and action towards sustainable practices.  

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to provide a detailed analysis of historical climate changes, offering insights into how human actions have shaped environmental conditions. By leveraging big data technologies, the project aims to equip future societies with the knowledge to prevent or mitigate detrimental climate impacts, supporting informed decision-making for sustainable development.
